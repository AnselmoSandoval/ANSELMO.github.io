        <h2>PBM Strand</h2>
        <p>The Pre-Baccalaureate Maritime specialization is a modified program of the STEM strand under the Academic Track. In this specialization, six specialized subjects of the STEM strand were retained and three were replaced with maritime â€“ related subjects. The goal of the Pre-Baccalaureate Maritime Specialization is to encourage SHS graduates to pursue maritime higher education. With this, the country will be able to produce more seafarers at the officer level.</p>
        <h3>Major Subject: Pre Baccalaureate Maritime (PBM)</h3>
        <p>General Physics : In the context of the PBM strand, General Physics refers to the study of the fundamental principles of physics that are relevant to the maritime industry. It covers topics such as mechanics, thermodynamics, waves, and optics, with a specific emphasis on their application in maritime settings. Students in the PBM strand learn about the physical laws and principles governing the motion, forces, and energy involved in maritime transportation and navigation.</p>
        <p>General Chemistry : As a major subject in the PBM strand, General Chemistry focuses on the principles and concepts of chemistry that are essential in the maritime field. It involves the study of chemical properties, composition, and behavior of substances, with a particular emphasis on their relevance to maritime operations. Students learn about topics such as chemical reactions, stoichiometry, chemical bonding, and the properties of elements and compounds that are significant in maritime logistics, port management, and marine engineering.</p>

            <h3>Activities of PBM Students</h3>
            <p>The PBM (Pre-Baccalaureate Maritime) strand engages students in various physical activities to complement their maritime education. These activities include physical fitness training to enhance their stamina and endurance,and hands-on maritime skills training to develop practical expertise. Through these physical activities, PBM students build their physical strength, agility, and teamwork skills, preparing them for the physical demands of the maritime industry.</p>
